# Markdown Tools (mdt)

This project implements a few utilities for markdown files that I need personally.

Currently, it is implementing functionality to wrap mermaid diagrams with an HTML block that renders the code with an URL pointing to mermaid ink

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```
